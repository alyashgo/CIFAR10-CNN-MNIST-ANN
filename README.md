We take full responsibility of the code provided.

## About:
We use PyTorch for both the parts. In the first part, we create a neural network of two hidden layers, using the Adam Optimizer and Cross Entropy Loss for classifying on the MNIST dataset. We compare the unregularised model with its regularised counterparts such as L2 regularisation, Dropout and Early Stopping.

In the second part, we built a CNN to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve the highest accuracy on the validation set as possible. This includes toying with hyperparameters and the artichecture of the model and plotting the results.
